# Introduction  

This repository holds 3 separate coding tests in their respectively named directories; python, ansible, and terraform.

<br>

# Python  
This test consists of a Python script that gathers data via an API call. Parts of the code have been omitted. You'll need to clone the repository,determine which parts are missing, and fix the mistakes.

<br>

# Ansible  
This test has an Ansible playbook that uses the same API call as the Python test. You'll need to fix any mistakes and successfully run the playbook by passing the subnet and the mask as Ansible extra vars"

<br> 

# Terraform   
This test also uses the same API call as the others. Fix any mistakes you find and run terraform plan to display the API call output.
